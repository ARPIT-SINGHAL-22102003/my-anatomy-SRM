-> Javascript: It is a programming language used to make web page interactive. It adds dynamic behaviour like validating forms, event handling, animations, ajax call, etc

->where is js used?
    => web development
    => server side(node js)
    => mobile apps(react native)
    => game development

-> why Javascript?
    => lightweight and fast
    => interpreted language
    => client side language
    => support OOPS and functional programming

-> it is case sensitive
->it is known as ECMAScript(ES)
    => ES is the standard specification that defines how the javascript should work.
     ** Javascript is the implementation of the ECMAScript standard.
-> Old Javascript (Vanilla Javascript | ES5)
-> New feature --> (ES 6 - 12)

-> how javascript program is executed?
    =>Load HTML page --> if there is any javascript code, the browser loads it and run javascript
    => JS code is run by the javascript engines
        ==> In every browser there is an javascript engines
            V8 : chrome, edge
            spidermonkey : firefox
            JavascriptCore : safari
        ==>Modern engines compile javascript into machine code for better performance (JIT)

-> extension is .js
-> code is write on <script> tag  
-> How we run JS program
    =>Internal
        ==> <html>
                <head>
                    <script>
                        JavaScript
                    </script>
                </head>
                <body>
                </body>
            </html>
    =>External
        ==> first.js
                JavaScript code
            home.html
            <html>
                <head>
                    <script src="first.js">
                    </script>
                </head>
                <body>
                </body>
            </html>

-> How we display JS Output?
    =>document.write("--") // display in the browser
    =>console.log("--"); //  display in console(debug our console)  // all javascript errors display in console
    =>alert() : display message in dialog box

->JavaScript is all about functions and events
    => function : for reusability
            //define the function
            function function_name(){
                
            }
            //call
            function_name()
    => events : perform a specific task in a program
        ==> onclick, ondblclick, onmouseover, etc


-> What is JavaScript Program : It is a set of statements that tell what to do. It can be just few line or 100s of files

-> Statements : are the instruction that perform an action. It separated by semicolon(;) (In JavaScript it is optional)

    eg: var x = 10;

-> Keyword : reserved word that have a special meaning
    var, if, for, while, dowhile, else, break, continue, function, return, null, true, false, undefined, etc.

->JS comments : are used to describe the code
    => single line : //
    =>multipleline : /*  */ 
->Variables : it is a temporary memory location which holds input data or it is a container for storing data.
    rule:
        => start with [a-zA-Z] or (_)
        =>after that combination of [a-zA-Z0-9_$]
        eg. 
            var firstName
            var first_name
        
    ->how we declare Variables
        ==> var varname = value;(old approach, function-scoped, less preferred)
    ->es6 introduce 
        ==> let varname=value;(blocked scoped)
                let age = 18;
            const varname = value;(block scope, cannot be reassigned) (constant)

-> Identifier: is the name we give to a variable, function or object

**We cant declare datatype at a variable initialization time, it allocate at runtime as per the variable value.
        typeof variable name: find the datatype of a variable.
        types of datatype
            -> primitive : string, number, boolean, null , undefined, symbol, bigint
            -> non-primitive: object, arrays,
                type of: object, array, null is object
